# TechGuyNum2005's BonziWORLD Revived 2020 Remake
This is a work-in-progress project of a replica of Apples' 2020 version of BonziWORLD Revived!. **Like I said, this is a BonziWORLD respiratory for gorillas, parrots and paperclips.**

# What the hell is this?
BonziWORLD Revived is a node.js and socket.io-based chat client featuring the characters of Microsoft Agent. The client uses speak.js to provide text-to-speech voices. Runs the same as BonziWORLD albeit with new features, colors and more, respectively.
